## Concept

This web application is a submission for Portfolio Project 5 with a focus on ecommerce. Given the criteria of the project, I needed a concept that would process payments with Stripe and that could be marketed on Social Media platforms. I decided on an online cheesemonger because there are lots of varieties to categorise it by and it has a universal appeal which means it is easily marketable.

I also wanted a concept that I could expand further. Given the deadline and the requirement for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), I held back on integrating features that were not completely necessary. In future CheesyStore could expand to include recipes, pairing guides and an integrated chatbot with the ChatGPT API.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were developed at the outset of my project. The general framework for how the website should be structured has remained the same. These served as a basis for my design from the beginning and prevented me from deviating too far in another direction. I created them partly because I understood that could could easily be made responsive to smaller screen sizes with bootstrap.
